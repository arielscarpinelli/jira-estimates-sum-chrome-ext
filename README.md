Sum of Jira point and time estimates for columns and total for sprint
Displays a sum of estimates (works for both points and time) at the top of each column and a total next to the sprint title.

Works with:
- Classic Scrum Board (both points and time estimates)
- Next Gen Scrum Board

For time estimates it takes Jira defaults - 60 minutes, 8 hours, 5 days.
